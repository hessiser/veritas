# veritas
Veritas, the magnum opus, of a mundane-chalk-throwing pillar man. Long-lost brethren of Kars, Esidisi, Wamuu, and Santana. Perhaps a Hirohiko Araki's critically acclaimed JoJo's Bizarre Adventure reference? Could be for the game JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven. Powered by rust and egui.
