Veritas, the magnum opus, of a mundane-chalk-throwing pillar man. Long-lost brethren of Kars, Esidisi, Wamuu, and Santana. Perhaps a Hirohiko Araki's critically acclaimed JoJo's Bizarre Adventure reference? Could be for the game JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven. Powered by rust and egui.

# Troubleshooting
- **The in-game overlay is not showing.**

  Disable any other apps that uses an overlay with the game (e.g. Discord) and restart the game.

- **The game is not processing keyboard/mouse inputs.**

  If your mouse is hovering over the overlay, it will consume all mouse inputs. If the overlay is taking keyboard inputs, it will consume all keyboard inputs as well. Either move your mouse away or click around the overlay, or use the hide UI shortcut.
